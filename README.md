# malo-selo
Arma mission set in the Bosnian war. Open-world campaign-style co-op mission.

# Installation
* Create a folder named "malo_selo.Woodland_ACR" in the directory "Documents\Arma 3\mpmissions\".
* Place the repository contents in this folder and drag the preset.html into the Arma 3 launcher mods section. 
* Run the mission from a LAN or internet session (dedicated server not guaranteed to function properly)

# Performance
* Since the mission is still incomplete, performance may not be completely optomized. 
* By default, the mission should adjust the view distance and simulation distance according to your framerate.
* Settings can be adjusted in config.cfg or in-game from the pause menu in "Configure -> Addon Options -> Malo Selo".

# Saving
* Vanilla saving is disabled for this mission because it cannot function properly with the size of the mission
* Instead, persistent saving is built into the mission and enabled by default. Mission progress is saved to your user profile automatically. This can be configured in the mission settings (see #performance).
