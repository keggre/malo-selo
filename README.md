# malo-selo
Arma mission set in the Bosnian war. Open-world campaign-style co-op mission.

# Installation
* Create a folder named "malo_selo.Woodland_ACR" in the directory "Documents\Arma 3\mpmissions\" and place the repository contents in this folder.
* Open the Arma 3 launcher and click "local mod" then add "Documents\Arma 3\mpmissions\malo_selo.Woodland_ACR\@malo_selo\" as a local mod.
* Drag the preset.html into the Arma 3 launcher mods section. Ensure it includes the local mod.
* Find the Malo Selo in the mission selection screen under "Bystrica" and run the mission from a LAN or internet session (dedicated server not guaranteed to function properly)
* The mission adjusts to suit the player count, so it can be played solo or with others.

# Performance
* Since the mission is still incomplete, performance may not be completely optomized. 
* By default, the mission should adjust the view distance and simulation distance according to your framerate.
* Settings can be adjusted in "CONFIG.cfg" or in-game from the pause menu in "Configure" -> "Addon Options" -> "Malo Selo".

# Saving
* Vanilla saving is disabled for this mission because it cannot function properly with the size of the mission
* Instead, persistent saving is built into the mission and enabled by default. Mission progress is saved to your user profile automatically. This can be configured in the mission settings (see #performance).
* A list of completed missions is also periodically saved to the RPT log file. Search for "MALO SELO MISSION PROGRESS".
